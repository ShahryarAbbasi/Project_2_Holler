# Holler

## Project Description
Holler is a full CRUD mockup application of the popular social media website Twitter. The idea originally came from the Ice Code Trucker classroom section where users and fellow students can assume the identity of a trucker. Users are able to create a username or 'handle' and from there be able to create a holler that can contain a text-based message and/or image.
