# Holler

## Project Description
Holler is a full CRUD mockup application of the popular social media website Twitter. The idea originally came from the Ice Code Trucker classroom section where users and fellow students can assume the identity of a trucker. Users are able to create a username or 'handle' and from there be able to create a holler that can contain a text-based message and/or image. The main feed displays all hollers, sorting from newest to oldest. Users can also click on a handle to view all hollers posted with that handle. Other functions include the ability to edit and delete hollers.

## Project Difficulties
* Matching handles and hollers on the main feed.
* Tried implementing bootstrap but could not get it to cohesively work with our project.
* GitHub branching and merging in the intial stages of development. 

## Future Goals
* Implementing a affirmative (like) feature.
* User authentication.
* Holler backs (replies).
